<h1>Network Training & Exploitation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This lab walkthrough focused on exploring and understanding various network services and protocols as presented in the TryHackMe Network Services 2 room. The primary objective was to gain practical experience in cybersecurity by engaging with exercises related to NFS, SMTP, SSH, and MySQL.



<h2>Achievements:</h2>

- **Service Enumeration:** Successfully enumerated NFS, SMTP, and MySQL services, identifying open ports, running services, and potential attack vectors within target environments
- **Vulnerability Identification:** Explored common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations associated with NFS, SMTP, and MySQL services, including insecure file permissions, weak authentication mechanisms, and privilege escalation opportunities.
- **Exploitation Techniques:** Learned and applied exploitation techniques specific to NFS, SMTP, and MySQL services, including leveraging SUID files, brute-force attacks, and password cracking, to gain unauthorized access and escalate privileges
- **Scripting and Automation:** Utilized Metasploit modules and Nmap scripts to automate enumeration and exploitation tasks, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in network penetration testing engagements

<h2>Skills Demonstrated: </h2>

- **Service Enumeration and Analysis:** Demonstrated proficiency in using Nmap and Metasploit for service enumeration and analysis, enabling the identification of potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- **Exploitation Techniques:** Developed skills in exploiting vulnerabilities associated with NFS, SMTP, and MySQL services, including privilege escalation, password cracking, and SUID file manipulation
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successfully escalated privileges on target systems by exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in NFS, SMTP, and MySQL services, showcasing the ability to gain unauthorized access to critical resources
- **Security Assessment:** Conducted comprehensive security assessments of network services, including NFS, SMTP, and MySQL, by identifying and mitigating security weaknesses and recommending remediation measures
